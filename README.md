## Late-night July üõùüéÜ
Fireworks & a playground. Made with Blender, THREE.js, and A-FRAME over about a week. 

This is my submission for the [Frappucino hackathon](https://hackaccino.hackclub.com/) of 
[hack club](https://hackclub.com) üòã


## Notes

Models not listed at the bottom are OC, namely the playground lol.

I had to bake lighting onto the playground because I can't really set up a good shader inside of A-FRAME unfortunately. If you have blender installed, you're welcome to go look around original file with cycles rendering engine. It's the full_scene.glb

To change the **SUN** position, go to `Layout` mode, then you should see a view in the bottom right with a lot of tabs. Click the red earth button (`World settings`) and now you can change the `Sun elevation` in degrees !

## License ?
just ask me to use the model cuz it took a while to make
I won't like sue you if you do steal it without asking, but I will be very sad and lose faith in humanity
